## Introduce

Monsters Rolodex is a funny pet project which I build to relearn React after long time work with Vue JS. React is awesome so I want to continue my journey with it. This project is the begin of my React journey.<br/>
If you are interested in my project you can clone my repo by following steps: <br/>
1. Open a terminal and type: `git clone git@github.com:nvDai/monsters-rolodex.git`
2. Then type `yarn` or `npm install`
3. Finally type `yarn start` or `npm run start` to enjoy Monster Rolodex.<br/>

I deployed Monster Rolodex to Github Page so you can visit [Monster Rolodex](https://nvdai2401.github.io/monsters-rolodex/) to see web demo.
